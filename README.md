# React_Clicky_Game

This app is a memory click game built using React.js. The user will click on an Avengers character and the user will score a point for every click. Once the object is clicked, the rest of the objects will randomly move, so the user will need to remember what character they clicked! If the user clicks on the same Avenger twice, then he/she loses. For the sake of having winners, I chose to 6 points as the bar to win the game. Therefore, if the user scores 6 points, he/she wins!
